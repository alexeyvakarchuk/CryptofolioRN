### Installation

Cryptofolio is an iOS app, it doesn't have Android support now.
You need to have the XCode and react native installed before you will run the project:
```
npm install -g react-native-cli
```

Then install project's dependencies:
```
yarn install
```
Use this to run the project with XCode simulator

```
yarn ios
```

and use this to run it on your IPhone(you need to connect it via USB and add it to Xcode at first)

```
yarn ios-device
```
